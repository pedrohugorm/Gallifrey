A set of C# libraries aiming to abstract most of the behavior systems require do go thru the UI and the Database

The project started earlier in my career due to the huge amount of websites I'm developing in Angular JS and most of them had a similar code behavior: Fill a form, and save it to the database. Even some of them having some custom rules, the layering is pretty much the same.
By noticing this repetition, and aiming to improve code performance, I started this project to share my findings and get feedback from the community.

The name of the project came from Doctor Who, a BBC tv show.
